This was my very first Python project and I started learning Python by working on this project. This is why I didn't use numpy or practical built-ins. At this point, I only new the syntax. However, the implemented algorithms work.

# How To:

All algorithms can be used in the script main.py.


## `greedy(varCosts,fixCosts,potentialLocs)` 

Finds a heuristic solution for the warehouse location problem. It prints a table with information in each iteration.

### Parameters

- varCosts: Matrix where $c_ij$ is the cost for transporting one unit from $i$ to $j$ as 2d-list.
